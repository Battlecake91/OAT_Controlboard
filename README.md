# OAT_Controlboard
Controlboard for the OpenAstroTracker

A project idea for a dedicated controlboard for the OpenAstroTracker https://github.com/OpenAstroTech/OpenAstroTracker
It should have: MCU, Stepperdrivers (directly soldered or as modules), onboard MPU6050, LiPo-BMS / Charger, onboard GPS module and what ever makes sense
